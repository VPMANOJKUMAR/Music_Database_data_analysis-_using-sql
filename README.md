# Music_Database_data_analysis-_using-sql
## Project Overview:

This Project is made by using  **SQL** to analyze and extract insights from a music database. By examining tracks, albums, artists, and genres, it aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in the data, enabling informed decision-making and enhancing music-related applications.

## Data Sources:
<a href="https://github.com/VPMANOJKUMAR/Music_Database_data_analysis-_using-sql/blob/main/music_database.sql">Music Database</a>

It consist of following tables:
+ album
+ artist
+ customer
+ employee
+ genre
+ invoice
+ invoice_line
+ media_type
+ playlist
+ playlist_track
+ track
## Tool Used:
![PostgreSQL](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTnL940atryNqZL_f80a99rC6kmhRSSp9FxuU4qBuxg8g&s)  




**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open source **object-relational database system** that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

## Questions solved:
From  **Music Database** easy level to advance level questions are solved by using the **SQL**.  

**The questions are as below:**  
Q1: Who is the senior most employee based on job title? 

Q2: Which countries have the most invoices?  

Q3: What are the top 3 values of total invoice  

Q4: Which city has the best customers? We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns one city that has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name & sum of all invoice totals  

Q5: Who is the best customer? The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Write a query that returns the person who has spent the msot money.  

Q6: Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners. Return your list ordered alphabetically by email starting with A  

Q7: Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands

Q8: Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. return the Name and Milliseconds for each track. Order by the song length with the longest songs listed first.  

Q9: Find how much amount spent by each customer on artists? Write a query to return customer name, artist name and total spent  

Q10: we want to find out most popular music Genre for each country. We determine the most popular genre as the genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres.

## Conclusion:
Leveraging PostgreSQL for solving questions in the Music Database has proven to be effective and efficient. By utilizing SQL queries, I am  able to extract valuable insights and find answers to specific questions related to music tracks, albums, artists, and genres. The flexibility and power of PostgreSQL allowed me to perform analysis, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on the results.
